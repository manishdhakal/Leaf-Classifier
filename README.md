# Leaf-Detector
## Convolutional Neural Network implemented in Python
### Tools used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras

The dataset contains 100 classification with each type having 16 images. The accuracy of Neural Net can be increased by increasing number of epochs. Model is working perfectly.

Link of the dataset is [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00241/100%20leaves%20plant%20species.zip) which is a zip file. Create a folder "dataset" and extract the content of the zip file inside that folder.

Run the command to install the required virtual environment
```sh
virtualenv  leafvenv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
