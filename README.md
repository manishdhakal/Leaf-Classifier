# Leaf Classifier
## Convolutional Neural Network implemented in Python
### Tools used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras

- No. of classifications -> 100
- No. images under each classification -> 16

The accuracy of Neural Net can be increased by increasing number of epochs. Model is working perfectly.

Link of the dataset is [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00241/100%20leaves%20plant%20species.zip) which is a zip file. Create a folder "dataset" and extract the content of the zip file inside that folder.

Run the command to install the required virtual environment
```sh
virtualenv  leafvenv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
